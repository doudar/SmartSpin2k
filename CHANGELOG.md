## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added functions to start and stop WiFi and Http server.

- Default stepper power is now used on reset to defaults. 
- Refactored Main and HTTP Server.
- Changed from hard coding to Enums in BLEServer.
- Added simulateWatts to ERG mode internal check.
- Increased BLE Stack(s) and reduced ERG stack. 
- Disabled shifter ISR while ERG is running. 
- Fixed possible infinite loop in ERG when stepper never reached target position due to being past min or max position.
- When UDP logging is enabled, html will no longer request logging info. 
- Increased remote server minimum packet delay to 325ms and max to 700ms. 

### Hardware
- Added Ultra Short Case mod which should allow as little as ~40mm from knob center to head tube.

### Hardware
- 

#### IC4 Mod
- 

## [1.12.26]

### Added
- Added Webpage for Shifting.

- Split userConfig into userConfig and rtConfig.
- Added ERG testing to btsimulator.html
- Broke out ERG computation into it's own task.
- Added image for wiki.

### Changed
- Adjusted the order of "Submit" "Reboot" and "Reset to Defaults" on the settings page.

### Hardware
- Increased hex head and nut size to 13mm.
- Increased depth on Knob Cup 2mm so a thicker nut can be used. 
- Added assembly .gif images.

#### IC4 Mod
- NEW: Hex bolt mod for 40t gear and matching ic4 cup/mount. This is a drop-in replacement for the plastic printed gear + cup/holder combination. This adds a lot of strength
- Renamed directory to something more apparent.
- Removed need for support material from case.
- Thicker slide design which removes need for washers.
- Slightly shorter slide - should allow more flexibility for ss2k placement on IC4.
- Tighter tolerances on case and bike mount for slide fitting. It should be a tight enough to prevent accidental removal
- Slightly larger diameter holes for m3 screws used in case assembly. Screws should be much easier to insert
- Additional tolerance for m5 fitting.
- Combined knob cup & knob insert for schwinn to reduce amount of plastic needed for the schwinn.
- Including a revised 11t stl - A bit more clearance on inner diameter the drive shaft on my steppers.

*1.3.21
* SS2K BLE Server now accepts more than one simultaneous connection (you can not connect SS2K to both Zwift and another app simultaneously)
* Echelon bike is now supported
* SmartSpin2K.local more accessible with different browsers (fixed certain MDNS dropouts)
* Flywheel bike support built in (still untested)
* Backend (client) completely revamped to allow more device decoders, better stability, and faster network speeds.
* Lots of FTMS server and client polishing
* Added testing for decoders
* Versioning now comes from releases
* NimBLE library included
* Increased total max connections to 6 devices
* Refined debugging logs

*1.2.15
* Fixed BLE cadence when accumulated torque values are present
* Lowered memory footprint
 
*1.2.6
* Added limited Telegram BLE debugging information for development. No sensitive information is sent back. I can make this telegram info available as a private group (in Telegram) if anyone is interested in seeing it. This was added because there are a couple BLE devices that don't seem to conform to the standard protocol and we need more information about them to get them to work properly. 
* Internal web UI links now use IP address instead of the local DNS name for compatibility with certain routers. 
* Added a favorite icon (favicon.ico) for browser compatibility.
* Fixed an BLE bug which would occasionally cause a crash on scanning. 
* Changed priority of subroutines and optimized task memory footprint. 
* Streamlined the WiFi connect sequence.  

*0.1.1.22
* Power meter will now switch to the most recently connected and disconnect the other.
* Double power option in the Bluetooth scanner webpage.
* Bluetooth scanning now happens via a flag set in the client task.
* Backend of the Bluetooth scanning page revamped.
* Removed dedicated HTTP server callback for the Bluetooth scanner.

*0.1.1.11
* All metrics now zero when correct BLE !connected.
* Added HR->PWR off/auto switch.
* WiFi starts up faster.
* BLE now connects device on save.
* BLE Scans are less error prone.
* MDNS Fix for certain android browsers.
* and probably lots of other stuff. 

*0.1.1.2 A new binary version is out in OTAUpdates. Units should automatically update to this newest version.

* Changes:
* WiFi Fallback to AP mode is now 10 seconds.
* WiFi AP mode Fallback SSID is now device name (MDNS name), and the password is whatever you have set.
* ERG Mode slightly more aggressive.
* Stealthchop 2 now selectable in settings.
* Holding both shifters at boot resets the unit to defaults and erases filesystem. (firmware remains intact)
* Holding both shifters for 3 seconds after boot preforms a BLE device scan/reconnect.

* Bugfixes:
* Automatic Updates setting switch now works :)
