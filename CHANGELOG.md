* All metrics now zero when correct BLE !connected.
* Added HR->PWR off/auto switch.
* WiFi starts up faster.
* BLE now connects device on save.
* BLE Scans are less error prone.
* MDNS Fix for certain android browsers.
* and probably lots of other stuff. 

*0.1.1.2 A new binary version is out in OTAUpdates. Units should automatically update to this newest version.

* Changes:
* WiFi Fallback to AP mode is now 10 seconds.
* WiFi AP mode Fallback SSID is now device name (MDNS name), and the password is whatever you have set.
* ERG Mode slightly more aggressive.
* StealthChop 2 now selectable in settings.
* Holding both shifters at boot resets the unit to defaults and erases filesystem. (firmware remains intact)
* Holding both shifters for 3 seconds after boot preforms a BLE device scan/reconnect.

* Bugfixes:
