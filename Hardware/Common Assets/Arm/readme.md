This directory contains the arm you will use to connect the SmartSpin2k to the Bike Mount from the other folder. You can measure from the back of the head tube to the center of the knob and subtract 65. That will give you an approximation of the arm length you need. The table below will help you make your selection in determining which length arm is appropriate for your bike. In addition, you may use the customizer in Thingaverse to make any length arm that you wish.
