These are the parts that adapt your knob to the SmartSpin2k. 

You'll see two of most of these because as we make them we've designed two slightly different sizes to accommodate 

Design Reference Photos are the images and dimensions we've used along the way to create various inserts. 
Most of the new knobs have been designed in Solidworks because that's currently  @doudar 's favorite CAD program. Feel free to recreate them in your favorite CAD program and we will happily PR them into a subfolder for that program.
