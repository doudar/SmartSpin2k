# Bowflex C6 / Schwinn IC4 mod
This mods the version2 case of SmartSpin2k to have a dedicated mount for a Schinn IC4 / Bowflex C6.  This should work with other bikes with minimal modification.  Bike mount.stl is intended for semi-permanent installation with zip ties or VHB tape.  This allows 1-handed installation and removal while offering a lot more rigidity than the original, highly portable design.

Fusion 360 exports and generic STEP files are both provided

## Revisions from standard version 2 case:
- Designed for direct mounting to a bike's head tube - Schwinn IC4 and Echelon Connect Sport mounts currently available.
- Replace wood screws with M3 threaded inserts to accept m3 screws. Source from [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000232858343.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.21164c4dGhWHhY): M3 x 5 x 4 heat set inserts. (5mm diameter).
- Sturdy yet easy to install and remove between rides.

## BOM
- In addition to the electronics specced for the version 2 case, you will need:
- M3 x 5 x 4 heat set inserts. (5mm diameter).  Source from [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000232858343.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.21164c4dGhWHhY).  [Instructions for installation here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyof7fYFcuQ)
- 4xM3 screws - I think M3x8 or M3x10 should work. As long as it's long enough to go into the threaded inserts, the length doesn't matter.  There's plenty of clearance if it's too long
- 1 pc M5x12mm for the the arm
- 2pc M5x30mm - 1 for the bike mount and another for the case
- 3pc M5 nuts

For the bike mount, you have two options: VHB tape or something similar OR if you want to protect the paint and avoid adhesives, you can use the velcro strap and rubber sticker approach:

- 1pc 1/2" wide velcro cable tie - 8" works for Schwinn and Echelon.  [This or something similar.](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B001E1Y5O6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1)  
- 2mm non-slip adhesive backed rubber.  [Something like this](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00P5VQ7HE)
