# SmartSpin2k Revision 3.0 Announcement

We are excited to announce the release of SmartSpin2k revision 3.0! This new revision features a number of improvements, including:

* A new SMT PCB for easier and more reliable building.
* The ability to order the board pre-assembled from [SmartSpin2k.com](https://www.smartspin2k.com/purchase-kits)
* A pre-fabricated cable management solution.

SmartSpin2k is a DIY project that allows you to turn any spin bike into a smart trainer. With SmartSpin2k, you can connect your spin bike to Zwift, TrainerRoad, or other popular training apps. This allows you to control your bike's resistance automatically, track your performance, and compete with other riders online.

SmartSpin2k is easy to build and requires only a few simple tools. The [entire build process](https://github.com/doudar/SmartSpin2k/blob/develop/SS2kR3BuildingInstructions.pdf) can be completed in under an hour.

If you are looking for a way to turn your spin bike into a smart trainer, SmartSpin2k is the perfect solution. With its new features and improvements, SmartSpin2k rev 3 is the best version yet.

## Getting Started

To get started with SmartSpin2k, you will need the following:

* A spin bike with a resistance control knob.
* A 3D printer.
* A soldering iron and basic soldering skills.

Once you have these materials, you can follow the [these instructions](https://github.com/doudar/SmartSpin2k/blob/develop/SS2kR3BuildingInstructions.pdf) to build your own SmartSpin2k. If you'd prefer to buy a pre-assembled kit, we have them for sale at [SmartSpin2k.com](https://www.smartspin2k.com/purchase-kits) 

## Features

SmartSpin2k offers a number of features, including:

* Automatic incline resistance control: SmartSpin2k can automatically control your bike's resistance based on the resistance settings in your training app. This allows you to focus on your workout and not worry about adjusting the resistance yourself.
* SmartSpin2k ERG function is a great way to improve your cycling performance. It allows you to train at a consistent power output, which is essential for improving your speed and endurance. ERG stands for "electronic resistance control." It works by automatically adjusting the resistance on your bike based on the power output you set in your training app.
* Online competition: SmartSpin2k can connect to Zwift, TrainerRoad, and many other cycling apps allowing you to compete with other riders online. This is a great way to stay motivated and push yourself to new heights.
* Do you have a spin bike that doesn't output realistic or accurate power numbers? If so, you're not alone. Many spin bikes have inaccurate power meters that can make it difficult to track your progress and train effectively. With SmartSpin2k you can calibrate the power output of your spin bike. 

## Cost

The cost of building a SmartSpin2k varies depending on the cost of your 3D printer and the cost of the components. However, the total cost should be under $150.

## Conclusion

SmartSpin2k is a great way to turn any spin bike into a smart trainer. With its new features and improvements, SmartSpin2k Rev 3 is the best version yet. If you are looking for a way to improve your indoor cycling experience, SmartSpin2k is the perfect solution.
